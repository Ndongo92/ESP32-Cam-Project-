Features:
Capture photos using the ESP32-CAM module.
Store the captured photos onto a MicroSD card.
Customizable capture settings (e.g., resolution, image quality).
Error handling and logging.
Requirements:
ESP32-CAM module.
MicroSD card module.
Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
ESP32 board support package.
Required libraries (e.g., ESP32, SD, etc.).
Installation:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/esp32-cam-photo.git.
Open the project in the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
Install the necessary libraries using the library manager.
Connect the ESP32-CAM module and MicroSD card module to your ESP32 development board.
Configure the necessary settings in the project configuration file.
Upload the sketch to your ESP32 board.
Usage:
Power up the ESP32-CAM module with the MicroSD card inserted.
The ESP32 board will initialize and configure the camera module.
The system will capture a photo when a specific trigger condition is met (e.g., button press, timer, external event).
The photo will be saved to the MicroSD card.
The system may provide feedback through LED indicators, serial output, or other means.
Repeat steps 3-5 to capture more photos.
Troubleshooting:
Issue: Camera initialization fails.

Solution: Check the wiring connections between the ESP32-CAM module and the ESP32 board. Ensure that the camera module is properly connected and configured.
Issue: Photos are not being saved to the MicroSD card.

Solution: Verify that the MicroSD card is properly inserted into the MicroSD card module and that it is formatted correctly (FAT32 is recommended). Check the wiring connections and ensure that the code handles SD card initialization and file writing correctly.
Issue: Captured photos are of poor quality or resolution.

Solution: Adjust the camera settings in the code to set the desired resolution and image quality. Experiment with different settings to achieve the desired results.
